        computer network is a set of computers sharing resources located on or provided by network nodes. 
        The computers use common communication protocols over digital interconnections to communicate with each other. 
        These interconnections are made up of telecommunication network technologies, based on physically wired, optical, and wireless radio-frequency methods that may be a

        Computer and network surveillance programs are widespread today, and almost all Internet traffic is or could potentially be monitored for clues to illegal activity
        Surveillance is very useful to governments and law enforcement to maintain social concern

        adve  nt of programs such as the Total Information Awareness program, technologies such as high-speed surveillance computers and biometrics software, and laws such as the Communications Assistance For Law Enforcement Act, governments now possess an unprecedented ability to monitor the activities of citizens.[55]
